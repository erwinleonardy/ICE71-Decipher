# ICE71-Decipher

# Web crawling dictionary generator
A web crawler that crawls all social media pages of selected target in order to generate a password list used for speared dictionary attack.

# The Problem

- Brute force attack requires high time complexity
- Infeasible for a password of reasonable entropy
- Dictionary attack requires a good combo list which is often lacking

# Our solution

- Make use of existing web crawlers to gain information on target
- Use the information to generate the password list
- List to be used by existing password cracking tools
